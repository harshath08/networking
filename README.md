Iâ€™ve trained in CCNA fundamentals and completed academic projects in Cisco Packet Tracer, configuring VLANs, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF), and ACLs. I also have basic knowledge of DNS, DHCP, and Linux commands.

I am actively looking for entry-level roles or internships as a Network Engineer where I can apply my skills and gain real-world experience.
